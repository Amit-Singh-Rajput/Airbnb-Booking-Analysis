# **AirBnB Booking Analysis**

## **Problem Statement**

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company.

## **Analysis**
During the analysis, we have used different graphs such as boxplot, pie chart, distplot, scatter plot, line plot, bar plot, correlation heatmap to explore the dataset. Here are some of the key findings:

- People are more attracted to lower prices. Most of the Prices are ranging between 0 to 1000.
- Price and night stay are inversely proportional to each other. It means one has to pay more when staying for fewer days and the price will decrease if the night stay is longer.
- Minimum night stay provides a maximum number of reviews.
- There are some properties which have a price listed as zero which is quite unusual.
- The Entire Home/Apartment has the highest share followed by the Private Room.
- The Entire Home/Apartment is listed most near Manhattan, and Private rooms and Apartments near Brooklyn are nearly equal.
- Manhattan has the most number of listings, followed by Brooklyn.
- Manhattan is the most expensive and the Bronx is the least expensive neighbourhood.
- On the basis of hostname Michael is the busiest host among all. And on the basis of reviews received Dona is the busiest as she has received the most number of reviews.
- Staten Island has more availability throughout the year.

## **Conclusion**

We have also observed that the Entire Home/Apartment has the highest share followed by the Private Room. Manhattan is the most expensive neighbourhood, while the Bronx is the least expensive. Staten Island has more availability throughout the year.
